Lavalink is a server based music player. You will need a Lavalink wrapper to converse with the Lavalink server, and a Discord wrapper like nextcord to converse with the bot.
Some good Lavalink wrappers I suggest are: 
Lavalink.py <https://github.com/Devoxin/Lavalink.py>, 
lavasnek_rs <https://github.com/vicky5124/lavasnek_rs>. 
You **cannot** use Wavelink and Pomice with nextcord as they now only support dpy.
