**1.** What do you want to add to nextcord? If you don't know we have a neat issue board (https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/issues)
**2.** Installing tooling. You need git, a editor, and python to develop NCv2
**3.** Fork nextcord. This can be done by going on the github linked above and clicking the fork button in the top right.
**4.** Download it locally. This can be done via github desktop or git. Please look up the respective ways to do so
**5.** Create a new branch for what you want to add.
**6.** Implement it! **TIP:** Use `python3 setup.py develop` to install it locally w/auto install. This means every time you update your code, it updates globally as a package.
**7.** Test it. Create a test bot that uses your feature in various ways, and see if any breaks unexpectedly
**8.** Create a pull request and get people's feedback on it!
