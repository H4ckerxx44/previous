**Can't run your file in VSCode even though you installed nextcord?**
You probably have the wrong interpreter selected.
 
To get your interpreter path / version, type `python -V` (or whatever is applicable to your system / what you install nextcord with) in a console.

Click on the python status in the Status Bar https://epic.embed.fail/lM5jIumi (If you can't see this, open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type `Python: Select Interpreter` and hit enter.)

Now select the interpreter version that you've previously seen in `python -V` hit enter and done.
