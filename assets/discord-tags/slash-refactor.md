Heyo people. You want (some of) Permissions v2, and you want it right now? What about (some) Localization support?
In progress, hot and ready code, fresh for testing? Do a good ol' `pip3 install git+https://github.com/alentoghostflame/nextcord.git@slash_refactor` and test out those hella fresh Application Commands. A LOT more info is at <https://github.com/nextcord/nextcord/pull/530>, so go there if you want to actually know more about it all, including examples!
If you experience any bugs, weirdness, or just want to talk about it, head on over the the <#881124672056467456> channel
and join the "Refactor of App Cmds and Additions feedback." thread. Warning though, if you use the <#881965127031722004> threads while using this fresh-off-the-presses application command code, you may get help banned.

Mods, if you see someone using this fork in the help thread and the help they need involves the app cmd refactor, please help-thread ban them.
~~DON'T FORGET TO LIKE AND SUBSC-~~
