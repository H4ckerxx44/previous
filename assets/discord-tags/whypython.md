We strongly recommend you go back and iron out your python skills
Nextcord and dpy are far more advanced than what can be derived from hardly knowing the basics
When you've learned better and understand the building blocks, then come back here and try again
With all due respect, if you get stuck at every error, we'd basically end up programming it for you as we answer each question.
It would be a frustrating experience for you, and we don't want you to be turned away by that
