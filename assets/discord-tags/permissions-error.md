are you getting a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'int' and 'NoneType'`? Well this was fixed, you can see how to install there. As python is weird you may have to use any one of these versions to install (use what you always use if you know) 
```sh
pip install -U nextcord
pip3 install -U nextcord
py -m pip install -U nextcord
python -m pip install -U nextcord
python3 -m pip install -U nextcord
python3.\{yourversion\} -m pip install -U nextcord```
