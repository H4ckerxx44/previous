**Adding your bot to nextcord**
To add your bot you must follow a few requirements.
Keep in mind these might change at any time, and some bots might have a exception to some of these rules.

Requirements: 
- Your bot can't use any of these prefixes: `! !! = hc! :: ?`
- You have to boost the server
- Your bot cannot respond with command not found messages 
- Your bot can only respond to commands, not any other events like member join, generic message etc
- Avoid responding to other bots/itself
- Only the `bot` scope will be granted and no permissions.
