**Databases**
Saving data when using nextcord is a common theme. In general when you have a quite often changing dataset (which will be mostly the case) you should consider using a database instead of opting for json.  For databses there are many different options out there, so called SQL and no SQL databses. If you already know one it is recommended to use the one you know.

__Why not json or saving to a file in general?__
`!!nojson`

__SQL or NoSQL__
`!!SQLvsNoSQL`

__SQL Alchemy__
`!!sqlalchemy`
