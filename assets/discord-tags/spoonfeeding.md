Give someone a fish, and you'll feed them for a day. Teach someone to fish, and you'll feed them for a lifetime. 

The simple fact is that, spoon feeding does not help you learn, and here we support and assist the growth and learning of programmers. That is, we would teach you to fish, and not give you a fish.

If you come in with a basic problem, and we hand the solution to you on a silver platter, you'll be back the next day without realizing it's the same thing, because you learned nothing. Helping you learn the logic, whereas, is beneficial for both me and you. It may seem tedious at present, but in the long run you'll save a lot of time when you don't have to ask for help with it anymore.

To "get started", we recommend a few basic things:
- How to read and understand documentation,
- How to read and understand errors and tracebacks,
- How to figure out where to look.
        Whatever you are facing, someone probably faced a similar issue and asked it before
        Or such is covered in the documentation
   The thing is, you need to learn to google.

First and foremost, understand the error. Try googling and searching relevant pieces of traceback and errors.

At the end of the day, fishing is worth more than a fish.
