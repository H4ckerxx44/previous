`is` compares the actual memory address to check if they **are** the same object. You can Google the word "singletons" to learn more

`==` compares the value of the object to see if they **equal/represent** the same thing

It's like saying **is** this car, also that car. And the answer is no, they are not the same thing.

They **are** the same *type* of car, but there still 2 cars.

**Fun fact:**
Python `==` is js `===`
`===` checks:
- Same value
- Same type
