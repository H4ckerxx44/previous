**You should not use Repl.it to host your bot.**

While this may seem like a nice and free service, it has a lot more caveats than you might think, such as:

- The machines are super **underpowered**.
- - This means your bot will lag a lot as it gets bigger.
- You need to **run a webserver alongside** your bot to prevent it from being shut off.
- - This isn't a trivial task, and eats more of the machines power.
- Repl.it uses an ephemeral file system.
- - This means any file you saved via your bot will be overwritten when you next launch.
-- Your **files will be lost**.

**- They use a shared IP for everything running on the service.**
This one is important - if someone is running a user bot on their service and gets banned, everyone on that IP will be banned. Including you.

-**Another Important one: Replit has alot of downtime**
-- Albeit what tutorials would have you believe, replit has a lot of downtime.
-- Not to mention, running a web server on your repl along side your bot in itself is a terrible idea, as it leeches a ton of system resources and what not.

Please avoid using repl.it to host your bot. It's not worth the trouble.
